      <title>Role-play?</title>

      <description>What is a role-playing game? A role-playing game, as played at our event, is often referred to as a tabletop role-playing game (you play at a table) or a pen-and-paper role-playing game (because pens and paper are almost always involved).
Imagine a group of 3-5 people telling a story together. It compares well with improvisational theatre, with the addition of game rules and dice that may propel the story in an unforeseen direction.</description>
